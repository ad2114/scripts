# Scripts

This repository will contain various scripts for working on data from the Mapping the Republic of Letters project. Every script is in a separate folder, together with a readme file containing detailed instrucions on how to run it.

Currently in the repository:

- **VIAF Match**: a Python script to find matches between a list of people and VIAF records and retrieve the VIAF ID. The script produces a .tsv file enabling domain experts to validate the automatically generated list of possible matches.
