# Scripts

This repository will contain various scripts for working on data from the Mapping the Republic of Letters project. Every script is in a separate folder, together with a readme file containing detailed instructions on how to run it.

Currently in the repository:

- **VIAF Match**: a Python script to matches people against VIAF records and retrieve their VIAF ID. The script produces a .tsv file to validate the list of possible matches.
- **GeoNames Match**: a Python script to match toponyms against GeoNames records and retrieve their GeoNames toponym, ID, feature code, and coordinates. The script produces a .tsv file to validate the list of possible matches.
